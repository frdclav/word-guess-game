# word-guess-game
## What the project does
* This project is a simple word guess/hangmang game using javascript. The page itself uses bootstrap. The player makes guesses via the text box. Guesses can either be 1 letter at a time, or trying to guess the entire word. The game keeps track of the users guessed letters. When a player guesses the word correctly, it adds a youtube video related to the word. The theme is kpop idol groups.
## Why the project is useful
* This project provides an example of javascript and object notation
## How users can get started with the project
* main javascript code is in game.js
* idols.js contains a list of idol objects. each object contains a "name" to be guessed in lowercase, "displayname" for displaying the name of the idol group and "embed" which has the embed code for the youtube video to be displayed.
